15 3Sum
018 4Sum
024 Swap nodes
023 Merge K sorted Lists, HEAP implemented
029 Divide Two Integers, integer operation, overflow situation
031 Next Permutation, permutation, situation analysis
034 Search for a range, practice
049 Group Anagrams, sort, comparison for "hash", use of TUPLE, complexity analysis
130 Surrouned Regions, border situation
054 Spiral Matrix, border situation
133 Clone Graph, not BFS, use dict
    Never Use iteration variable inside one line loop!!!
    e.g.:
    for i in range(5):
        print [i for i in range(10)]
136 Single Number, bit operation, using XOR to eliminate double number
113 Path Sum, basic binary tree and path, remember to pop the node in the path at the end of dfs function
114 Flatten Binary Tree
078 Subsets, for loop trick: don't modify the iterator during the process
069 Sqrt(x), binary search
082 Remove Duplicate, Linked list operation, ending case
238 Product of Array Except Self, Time complexity, Space complexity, TODO
088 Merger sorted arrays, write a time:O(m+n), space: O(1) solution, TOOD, do merge from RIGHT to LEFT
274 H-Index, O(n) solution??
010 Regular Expression Matching, corner case, dynamic programming condition
168 Excel Sheet Column Title, carefully considering about the recursive
